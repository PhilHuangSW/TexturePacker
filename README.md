## Background

I was assigned a texture packer problem and as I researched more into the NP-hard problem, the more invested I was. As I built the algorithm, it was hard to visualize just what was happening at first. However, slowly but surely, I pieced together a way to visualize it in a way that looked both informative and captivating at the same time. 

## Setting up

```shell
git clone https://github.com/PhilHuangSW/TexturePacker.git
cd TexturePacker
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Features

There were many features I kept wanting to add, but here are the ones I settled on:
 - User options including width, height, number of rectangles, and min/max size of rectangles
 - Timed Interval feature to visually see the algorithm at work
 - Dynamically rendered statistics 
 - Windowed Mode to automatically run the algorithm whenever the window size changes
 - Near instant packing algorithm using Binary Search
